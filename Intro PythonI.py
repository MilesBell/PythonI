#Desc: My first code using Python

#This is how I print Hello World
print("Hello World!")

#Adding two numbers
2+3

#Print
print("my name is Miles")
print("I'm a python programmer :)")


print("my name is 'Miles'.")
print("Miles","BUAN","2019")

print("my dad\'s name is LeRoy")
print("my name is \n Miles and my dad\'s name is LeRoy")

print("I'm born in "+"1998 "+ "on March 30th")
print("my dad's name is LeRoy \n"*10)

#versus (repeats "my dads name is LeRoy" 10 times each on a new line, versus just consecutive)

print("I'm born in "+"1998 "+ "on March 30th")
print("my dad's name is LeRoy "*10)

print("Miles", "LeRoy", "Koren", "Danielle", "Nicole")
print("MKTG 3000", "IS 3150", "UCOR 3100", "w/scores", ((4.0*4.0)/4.0), 4.0+4.0+4.0+4.0)

#modulus
print(2%5)
print(6%2)

name="John"
print("Hello", name)

name=input("Hi. What is your name?")
print(name)
print("Hi", name)
input("\nPress the enter key to exit.")

#^ the code is asking for the name as an input, then it prints the name, says "hi" t the name, then you can hit enter to exit (one line down with \n)

#BTW, string manipulation i.e. (lower()) or (upper()) or (title()) or change part inside string (replace()), swapcase() which switches the case of each letter, strip(), replace(old,new[,max])
